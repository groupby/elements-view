# SF-X Search Box Component

## Functionality

The component accepts text input and dispatches events based on input.

### Events

#### `sfx::searchbox_clear_click`

Dispatched when a user clicks on the clear button.

#### `sfx::searchbox_click_event`

Dispatched when a user clicks anywhere within the search box input area.

#### `sfx::search_request`

Dispatched when a user clicks on the search button or hits `enter` within the search box. This event sends the search term value entered into the search box.

#### `sfx::searchbox_change`

Dispatched when the value changes inside the search box input.

#### `sfx::update_search_term`

This component listens for this event, whose payload is the search term, and updates the value property and input box value with the event's payload.
